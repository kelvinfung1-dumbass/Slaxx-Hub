We are a team of developers that work day by night to make sure our users have a good experience...

SlaxxF, Magik hub's original creator, creates the ui's, codes most games, and handles the money gained. 
Fluke (AKA DangerMario) is one of the most helpful devs to Magik hub. Fluke has a very good coding skill and helps SlaxxF code many games.
PoggersCat is another very helpful dev to Magik hub. They made the whitelist system for magik hub and helped make magik hub more secure.
Fear_Scripts is a good friend of SlaxxF and has helped developed Baconator V2 (one of SlaxxF's projects for piggy) and now Magik Hub.
Fig used to be one of the head devs for magik hub but resigned and has persued GFX and game design.
